<p><h4>You will love this recipe for vegetarian biryani! It’s flavorful, aromatic, and loaded with veggies like carrots, bell pepper, potatoes, corn, and peas. You can make this a vegan recipe too, if you omit the ghee-coated cashews and raisins.

So… I think it’s official. I have a biryani problem.

I already have several different types of biryani on my blog, and you can expect more varieties to come soon. I have so many biryani recipe ideas floating around in my head. And by floating, I mean dancing. These biryani ideas are basically doing bhangra in my mind. Biryani Bhangra.💃🏽 hoi! bruahhh!</h4></p>
